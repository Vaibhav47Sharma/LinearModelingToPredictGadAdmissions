# Linear Models for Data Science final project
Regression analysis on graduate admissions data

Each year, over 3 million college applications are filed in the US by about 750,000 students [1], an average of 4
applications per student. Each of them comes with a certain element of randomness or chance. The intended
meritocracy inherent in college admissions gives way to uncertainty, doubt, and anxiety, even for students with
exceptional credentials. Not all colleges are transparent about their admission processes and so it becomes tough for a
student applicant to gauge whether he or she can get admission into an institution.
In this project, we demonstrate how regression analysis can be used on a sample dataset to ease this process. Universities
can use similar analysis on their data to help with the admissions process, and students can use this analysis to determine
how likely they are to get an admit given the strength of their profile.
